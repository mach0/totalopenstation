As announced in the previous blog post, the [Total Open Station project has a new home](https://github.com/totalopenstation/totalopenstation)!

More specifically, we're still on GitHub but I have moved the main repository from my personal GitHub account to the "totalopenstation" organization, with myself and @psolyca as owners.

This may seem like a simple step but, in fact, it is the most important improvement that Total Open Station has ever got. 

Before this change, we put a lot of effort to define how the new project will work, with a detailed [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/totalopenstation/totalopenstation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document (partly inspired by the great example of the [Gitea project](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) and a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/totalopenstation/totalopenstation/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (based on the Contributor Covenant). To ensure code quality, all changes must be approved through a review process before being merged into the master branch. This is enforced for all contributors, myself included! There is a process in place to expand the team of owners with new contributors.

We also gave official status to our Matrix chat room at https://matrix.to/#/#totalopenstation:matrix.org so if you're looking for casual tips or questions, please drop us a message there!

We are now looking forward to sharing the next release with all our users and with this in mind we introduced another important change: **sponsorship**. You can now support our work with a recurring donation, either via GitHub sponsors or Liberapay. Since the project is run as a volunteer effort, sponsorships will help us cover the cost of operating websites, testing hardware devices, and eventually buy a dedicated domain name. 

If you use Total Open Station please let us know and maybe give us a star â˜… on GitHub.
